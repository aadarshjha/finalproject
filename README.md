## Introduction

Herein, the use of augmented reality (AR) is explored in the application of Art Therapy (AT) for neurodivergent individuals. In particular, AT is defined as the "therapeutic application of image making" — with an emphasis on releasing the unconscious by art expression, encouraging a transference relation via free association. In effect, AT is considered to be a symbolic form of speech, unlocking another modality of communication [1]. Thus, AT is holistically an inclusive, and alternative, method of expression, allowing those who are unable to express themselves through conventional manners have access to therapy and treatment. Recent research demonstrates the shift of Art Therapists towards utilizing AT for individuals with neurodiversity, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and personality disorders [2]. Researchers have shown that the use of AT encourages psychological well-being, self-awareness, and improved mental health by emphasizing sensory regulation, individualized artistic experiences, socially appropriate skills, and encapsulating complex topics in a digestible manner [2, 3]. Inspired by the Neurodiversity-Inspired Engineering Courses (CS 8395, Dr. Keivan Stassun) — a course which emphasizes engineering approaches towards narrowing the gap between Neurodivergnt and Neurotypical individuals — an AR-Engineering approach is explored for AT. The overall goal of this project is to increase the accessibility of AT via an AR-based mobile drawing application, with a specific target audience of neurodiverse individuals.
