## Introduction

Herein, the use of augmented reality (AR) is explored in the application of Art Therapy (AT) for neurodivergent individuals. In particular, AT is defined as the "therapeutic application of image making" â€” with an emphasis on releasing the unconscious by art expression, encouraging a transference relation via free association. In effect, AT is considered to be a symbolic form of speech, unlocking another modality of communication [1]. Thus, AT is holistically an inclusive, and alternative, method of expression, allowing those who are unable to express themselves through conventional manners have access to therapy and treatment. Recent research demonstrates the shift of Art Therapists towards utilizing AT for individuals with neurodiversity, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and personality disorders.
